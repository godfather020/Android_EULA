        <h4>IMPORTANT. READ CAREFULLLY: </h4>
        <p>This End User License Agreement ("EULA") is a legal agreement between you (either an individual or a single entity) and Broadlink Data Services, LLC. ("EduTAB") for software, whether pre-installed or downloaded, owned by EduTAB and its affiliated companies and its third party suppliers and licensors, that accompanies this EULA, which includes computer software and may include associated media, content and data, printed materials, or electronic documentation in connection with your use of EduTAB Tablets, which will be defined below ("EduTAB Software").</p>
        <br />
        By using this device or any other EduTAB product, including EduTAB Tablets and accessories, running on Android operating system ("EduTAB Device"), you accept terms of this EULA. If you do not accept these terms, do not use the EduTAB Device or the EduTAB associated Software.
        <br />
        <h4> GRANT OF LICENCE.</h4>
        <p> EduTAB grants you a limited non-exclusive license to use, access, display and run one copy of the EduTAB Software on a single EduTAB Device, and you may not make any EduTAB Software available over a network where it could be used by multiple devices at any given time. You may not make any backups or copies of any software pre-installed on any EduTAB device without EduTABs permission. Certain items of the EduTAB Software may be subject to open source licenses. The open source license provisions may override some of the terms of this EULA. We make the applicable open source licenses available to you on the Legal Notices section of the Settings menu of your device.</p>

        <h4>RESERVATION OF RIGHTS AND OWNERSHIP.</h4>
        <p>
            EduTAB reserves all rights not expressly granted to you in this EULA. The Software is protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and treaties. EduTAB or its suppliers own the title, copyright and other intellectual property rights in the EduTAB Software. The EduTAB Software is licensed, not sold.
        </p>
        <h4>LIMITATIONS ON END USER RIGHTS.</h4>
        <p>
        You shall not, and shall not enable or permit others to, copy, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to discover the source code or algorithms of, the Software (except and only to the extent that such activity is expressly permitted by applicable law not withstanding this limitation), or modify, or disable any features of, the Software, or create derivative works based on the Software. You may not rent, lease, lend, sublicense or provide commercial hosting services with the Software. You may not transfer this EULA or the rights to the EduTAB Software granted herein to any third party unless it is in connection with the sale of the EduTAB device which the EduTAB Software accompanied. In such event, the transfer must include all of the EduTAB Software (including all component parts, the media and printed materials, any upgrades, this EULA) and you may not retain any copies of the EduTAB Software. The transfer may not be an indirect transfer, such as a consignment. Prior to the transfer, the end user receiving the EduTAB Device must agree to all the EULA terms. Where EduTAB Device is being used by your employee or other person using the EduTAB Device as part of your undertaking ("Your Staff"), that member of your Staff is licensed to use the EduTAB Software as if it were you and must comply with these terms on the same basis. Any failure to comply with these terms by your Staff shall be deemed to a failure to comply with these terms by you. This apply to institutions where a school purchased a EduTAB Device to be used by students and or parent purchased a EduTAB device to be used by child at home.
        </p>
        <h4>EduTAB SOFTWARE UPDATES.</h4>
        <p>
        EduTAB may make available to you updates, upgrades, supplements and add-on components (if any) of the EduTAB Software, including bug fixes, service upgrades (parts or whole), and updates, enhancements and feature improvements or deletion to any EduTAB Software (including entirely new versions), (collectively "Update") after the date you obtain your initial copy of the EduTAB Software. This EULA applies to all and any component of the Update, unless we provide other terms along with such Update. To use EduTAB Software provided through Update, you must first be licensed for the EduTAB Software identified by EduTAB as eligible for the Update.
        </p>
        While the Update will be generally available, in some limited circumstances, the EduTAB Software updates will only be offered by your local retailer, and such EduTAB Software updates will be governed by your contractual relationship with your local retailer.
        <p>
        With the "EduTAB download automatically" function enabled (as in the default setting in the "About Device" menu in the Setting), your device downloads certain Updates automatically from time to time through Wi-Fi / Data connection. If you have chosen to disable the "EduTAB download automatically "function, then you can check the availability of new Updates and download them by clicking on the "EduTAB download manually" menu in the Setting. Given the importance of receiving Updates for security software in a timely manner to defend against new threats, however, security-related Updates may be automatically downloaded and installed without your consent, even if you have disabled the "Software download automatically" function. This protects your EduTAB Device directly and every EduTAB Device in use via the concept of "herd" or "community immunity". We recommend that you check availability of any new Updates periodically for optimal use of your device.
        </p>
